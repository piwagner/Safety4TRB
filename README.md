# Safety4TRB
This project contains all the material needed for the paper submitted to the special call "ACP50 Towards Reproducible Transportation Research" to TRB 2023
The most important ones are the Rmd-file `TRB2023gitVersion.Rmd` which contains the paper and the code to produce the analyses and figure of the paper, the main data-file `resultsNew.rds` which is the tailored version of the data in the directory `newData`, and the bibtex file `TRB2023sage.bib` that contains the references.
